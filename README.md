# No New Tabs for Hyperlinks
No New Tabs for Hyperlinks is a Chrome extension that stops links from automatically opening into new tabs when you click on them. It automatically finds new links as they appear on the page, and it tells you how many links it has modified on a given page with a number above its icon.

## Installation
You can install this extension via its page on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-new-tabs-for-hyperlink/lgfmjmdopmbkkeaaoliegdkdjmpebgbk?hl=en-US&gl=US">Chrome Web Store</a>.

Alternatively, if you want to install it as a developer:

- Download/clone/whatever this repository
- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Check `Developer mode`
- Click `Load unpacked extension...`
- Select the `Extensions` folder you got from this repository.

## Testing
Two good sites for trying this extension out are Tumblr and Facebook. Both of those sites generate hundreds of links that automatically open into new tabs as you scroll down.
